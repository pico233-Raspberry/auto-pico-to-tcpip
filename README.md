别骂我写的不好，一个臭学cpp的写c肯定成不了好东西😭

这个我想要实现的是通过覆盆子pico模拟adb信号输入给手机开启adb无线调试，但现实总是残酷的，我编译了五十几次都没成功😭，希望大佬们帮帮我😭😭😭

Don't scold me for not writing well. A person who studies CPP can't write C well.😭😭😭
This I want to realize is through the raspberry pico simulation ADB signal input to the mobile phone to open ADB wireless debugging, but the reality is always cruel, I compiled more than fifty times without success, I hope the big guys help me😭😭😭.

tips:I used machine translation to translate English
